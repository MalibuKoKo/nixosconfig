# General server ramblings

If we give epi 64 gigs of ram, we'll be able to run most of our infrastructure on it from prom. It'll have the ram. It's easier to imagine half the ram running everything off of 32. Though the difference is $100. But we keep OOM'ing ourselves and I really think just maxing out the ram everywhere cannot hurt.
